Coding Challenge Two - Finish Our Angular TODO app
====

### Challenge Requirements:

_Est time: ~20-40min_

The TODO app integrates deepstream tech to provide our models with real-time updates, but it remains unfinished to this day. __Fork__ and finish the final functionality for the todo app (mark as done, mark as todo, and delete todo). Also, the app needs a bit of a paint job. Make it look a little nicer, ok? _(note* there is no delete UI for a todo item. impliment as you see fit.)_

After your done, submit a __rebased__ pull request.

### Installation:

```
npm install
```

### Requirements:

```
MongoDB
Node - v6.2.0
```
